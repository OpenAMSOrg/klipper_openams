# This is the FPS slide HES value (which shoudl be 0 when offloaded and 1 when fully loaded)
# at which the filament pressure on the FPS causes the AMS Hub Motor, to stop feeding
# any more filament to the toolhead extruder
fps_upper_threshold: 0.7
# This is the FPS slide HES value at which the filament pressure on the FPS causes
# the AMS Hub motor to work at full speed to the toolhead extruder
fps_lower_threshold: 0.3
# the fps_upper_threshold and fps_lower_threshold are averaged, so in this
# example (0.7 + 0.3)/2.0 = 0.5 to determine the middle point at which
# to aim to maintain the filament pressure.  The PID loop control
# continuously adjusts the AMS Hub motor speed to maintain this set point

# This value instructs if the FPS slide HES value should be reversed
# and is critical to the operation of the OpenAMS
# and the machine is on and unloaded (no filament)
# you can check the value of the FPS by checking klippy.log
# from the command line
# tail -f ~/printer_data/logs/klippy.log

# This value instructs the firmware on WHEN to start checking the
# value of the FPS slide to stop loading filament.
# When the OAMS has fed this ptfe_length - 100mm, it will slow down the speed of the feeder and 
# check if the slide is above the fps_upper_threshold.
# If this is the case, the loading will stop, assuming the 
# the filament bottomed out at the top of the gears of the toolhead extruder.
# If you have too much friction on the PTFE tubing, sharp bends, kinks, etc, you might
# have to solve these issues to lower the friction.
# A stiffer spring is provided with the OpenAMS kit to compensate for
# longer ptfe tube lengths.

# These values change the spool rewind behavior, by adjusting the speed of the Hub motor
